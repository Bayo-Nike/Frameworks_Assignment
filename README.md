I face the following to push the dataset
----------------------------------------
remote: error: File datasets/metadata.csv is 1571.55 MB; this exceeds GitHub's file size limit of 100.00 MB
remote: error: GH001: Large files detected.


Note on Large File Size

Due to the large size of the metadata CSV file from the COVID-19 dataset, it could not be directly pushed and uploaded to GitHub.
However, I have checked the file on my local machine, and the structure remains the same as intended.

Please accept this repository as-is, with the understanding that the full metadata CSV file has been correctly prepared and 
organized. The file structure is intact, and itâ€™s ready to be used once uploaded to a more suitable storage location.

For those looking for the full dataset, please refer to the COVID-19 dataset available on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge?select=metadata.csv
